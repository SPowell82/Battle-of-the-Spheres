# Tank War
Tank War is a 3D first person shooter made with java/java-fx in which the player travels around a world battling other military grade machines such as Tanks and drones to progress. This game was made with javaFx as a personal challenge, and not with more appropriate game engines such as Unity. The game is still in development and requires updates but provides a complete mechanism of player movement, ammunition firing, health and enemy movement with tracking and firing at the player. Currently the main player and enemy drones are represented as Spheres but will be updated. The main code is contained within Controller.java
